# CSGO Give Weapons
Give a weapon or item to a player from a command.  
This plugin is edited from [Kiske's give weapon](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=195476).  
This version added all items and weapons, and fixed targets list.  
It means you can finally give weapon or item to all players at the same time.  

## Commands
- `sm_weapon <target> <weaponname>` Gve weapon or item to user.
- `sm_weaponlist` Dsplay a list of all the weapon names.

## Items
You don't need to add `weapon_` or `item_` in the `<weaponname>`.
For example, `sm_weapon @all healthshot` gives all player `weapon_healthshot`, including bots.
